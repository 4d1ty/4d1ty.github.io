    <h4>Some projects:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/We-Love-Tomboys/Vitary"><code>Vitary</code></a>
            : Eh, It's a social media webapp which I made few years ago in django. It was pretty fun, I even
            hosted it on pythonanywhere, but the storage got over and I had to take it down.
        </li>
        <li> <a href="https://github.com/We-Love-Tomboys/PingVille"><code>PingVille:</code></a>

                    <a href="https://github.com/foxy4096/pingville-game"><code>pingville-game</code></a>
                    : It's a multiplayer game which I wrote in godot, It's kinda like club penguin, I implemented
                    the
                    user accounts and auth via the backend vanilla php (yup üíÄ)

                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://github.com/foxy4096/pingville-web"><code>pingville-web</code></a>
                    : This is the actual backend php server which I wrote for the <code>pingville-game</code>.
                    Somethings are messy. I could had used jwt so as no need to hit the db again and again, but what
                    can I say, I might be kinda of stupid üíÄ
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/We-Love-Tomboys/Nimbus"><code>Nimbus</code></a>: Not much to say, pretty new
            project, It's
            used my esp32 weather station and collect the data that gets piped in to a api route and is stored in a
            <code>weather_data.csv</code>. Currently I am just doing the data analysis with pandas and matplotlib, might
            add some scikit learn ml later :&rpar;
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/4d1ty/slog"><code>slog</code></a>: Idk even know what the name is supposed to be
            at first it was going to be a <strong>s</strong>hort b<strong>log</strong>, but then I got of the track and
            added the way to upload webgames and tried to made itch.io or friv or whatever you used to play online
            browser games. Kinda messy</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/foxy4096/hyperstar"><code>hyperstar</code></a>: It's a browser new tab page
            which I made with
            <code>react</code> and <code>chakra-ui</code>. I added 4 search engine to be used in this, google, bing(üíÄ),
            duckduckgo(üêê), wikipedia. The selected search engine option is saved in <code>localstorage</code>. There is
            not much to see on this (I am not a frontend developer üíÄ)

        </li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/jojoferret/graveyard-api"><code>graveyard-api</code></a>: What can I even say
            about this. It just a crud with auth and ratelimiting, for your forgotten idea, apps, startups
            <br>
            <strong>Why?</strong>
            <blockquote>
                Because not every idea gets finished.
                <br>
                Because not every project needs to be forgotten.
                <br>
                Because you deserve to laugh (or cry) at what you never shipped.

            <a href="https://github.com/foxy4096/Ineq"><code>Ineq</code></a>:
            It's a 2d procedurally side platformer game which I made in godot. It's like 2d minecraft or Terraria.

        <li><a href="https://github.com/pingfoxhq/pingfox"><code>PingFox</code></a>
            It was an easy website analytics app which I thought that I would had deployed on the server. But the god
            had other plans. During the development of PingFox I got really sick and got admitted to hospital and
            doctors said that my kidneys are all cooked and there is no way to recover from this. Now the only course is
            hemodialysis. So now I am currently on hemodialysis. I feel like this PingFox should now be published to the
            <code>graveyard-api</code> as now this project is dead. If you think you can revive, sure try to, contact me
            for the access.

    <h3>Some of my sayings: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Using javascript on the backend is cursed.</li>
        <li>Why tf did people even made electronjs. It should not be called electron. It's a fucking TON 618.
        </li>
        <li>
            I hate the devs at microsoft who are using react and webview to write the windows graphical ui components.
        </li>
        <li>
            "at least if I
            die and go to hell I won't have to look
            at javascript again". Imao where do
            you think javascript came from
        </li>
        <li>Everything is a crud if you look closely. Github CRUD, Facebook CRUD, Youtube CRUD...</li>
        <li>I don't hate ai, its just that I don't fully trust them. I don't want them generating the literature and
            arts or scientific things.
            I just want them to do the repetitive tasks. But they are even bad at them too.</li>
